        <h2>Current Situation and Reason Behind This Project</h2>
        <p>Since the beginning of the new ai revolution , many peapole including artits but not only 
           complained about the "death of art". Their belief is that ai will replace the artists because it's making
           art , faster and cheaper by reproducing what was already done before. I personnally dont think that they are right.
           To me ai should be used as a way to make art deeper. To give it a higher meaning. It is a tool which will make artists
           look for more than just beauty.   
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content" id="main_stuff">
        <h3>One Example That AI and Art Can Work Together</h3>
        <p>
            To illustrate my thought. I'll show you how a simple algorithm can help with an artistical process.
            The artistical process here is called builidng a Nonlinear Narrative  story. Basically a story where the chronological order is changed.
            This simple algorithm will perform this task.

        <p>
            In my opinion , this is a good example of how ai and artist can share a common ground and how ai should be used by artists in general.

            Here its not just making the text or anything but activly engaging into a crucial part of the artistical process just like the keyboard of the author of the
